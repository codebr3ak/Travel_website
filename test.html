                The great wildebeest migration.
                The wildebeest migration takes place within Kenya and Tanzania and is the greatest migration show on earth. Thousand of wildebeest 
                and zebras migrate to greener pastures as the season changes between the open plains of Serengeti and Masai Mara and the circle of life and death continues.
                Predators follows wildebeest closely, waiting for an opportunity to strike weak prey as they make their way into different territories.
                The precise timing of migration changes annually and it is a very unpredictable and spontaneous natural event.
